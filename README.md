Hello friends.

My name is Nancy Jennifer Ng and I am an aspiring software developer/engineer. I am always open to learn about anything in Computer Science! 

💻I am a 2nd-degree student and an incoming senior at Hunter College  
🎓I am currently majoring in Computer Science  
🔬I graduated university on May 2018. My first degree was a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the Unveristy at Buffalo  
🌟Fun fact: I am an undergraduate teaching assistant in Programming in C++ and Programming in Python. 

🌟I love to participate in Hackathons with friends, so feel free to reach out to me to collaborate. 


The projects I am currently working on are:  

[]StonkStache- an educational tool for users who are interested in investing in a stock of their choice  
[] BB_remindme- an server reminder bot that reminds users when assignments are due and allows them to add tasks to google calendar
